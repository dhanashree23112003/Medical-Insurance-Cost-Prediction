# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. It helps in estimating potential costs, benefiting both insurance companies and individuals.

---

## 🛠 Features
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface for predicting insurance costs.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into the relationships between key variables.
- **Regression Modeling**: Implementation of machine learning models for prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² used for assessing the model.
